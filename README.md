### B2B SaaS customer support

A software company that sells to other companies.

We have a customer support system

First come first serve queue - two sided - meaning there’s a line of customers and also a line of support staff.

We are getting complaints. Long wait times. It’s a concern that some of these complaints are coming from our larger customers.

What we want:

- EDA (understand the problem better)
- A way to monitor the support system (operational dashboard)
- ideas for how to make the system better (including, what data would be required for such a solution)
- implement the best idea

EDA questions:

- how long are users waiting?
- how long is too long to wait? -- when we get complaints, how long were the complainers waiting.
- how many users are waiting too long?
- how is the problem of "waiting too long" distributed across users from different sized companies
